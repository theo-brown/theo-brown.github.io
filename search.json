The problem is, we don’t know how to make the box.\n– Pierre Gilles de Gennes\n\n\n\nI’m a first year PhD student at the University College London, supervised by Ilija Bogunovic.\nMy project is jointly supported by the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), a government research institute seeking to lead the delivery of sustainable fusion energy, where I am a visiting researcher.\nI work closely with the UKAEA integrated modelling group, designing scenarios for the UK’s proposed next-generation fusion reactor."
