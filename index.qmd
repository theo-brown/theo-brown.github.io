# About me 

I'm a first year PhD student at the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/), supervised by [Ilija Bogunovic](https://ilijabogunovic.com/).

My project is jointly supported by the [UK Atomic Energy Authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority/about) (UKAEA), a government research institute seeking to **lead the delivery of sustainable fusion energy**, where I am a visiting researcher.

I work closely with the UKAEA integrated modelling group, designing scenarios for the [UK's proposed next-generation fusion reactor](https://step.ukaea.uk/).

## Research

Fusion power could be the biggest game-changer in history; to achieve it, we need advanced control systems and highly optimised designs.

My research connects ideas from **control**, **optimisation**, **Bayesian statistics**, and **plasma physics** in order to tackle the hardest engineering challenge humanity has ever faced.

Buzzwords that get me excited include:

- **Probabilistic** machine learning
- Verifiably **robust** and **safe** algorithms for critical systems
- **Trajectory** planning and **controller** design
- Adaptive and **learning-based** control
- **Physics-informed** machine learning
- Bayesian optimisation

## Hobbies

I'm often found in the garage doing woodwork or outside looking after my garden. 
I also love hiking, jazz, classic novels, korfball, and board games.

I'm a passionate advocate for wider recognition  and research concerning the long-term impacts of [mild traumatic brain injury](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/almost-half-of-people-with-concussion-still-show-symptoms-of-brain-injury-six-months-later).
